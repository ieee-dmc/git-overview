# DMC Tutorial - A Practical Overview of GIT

## Create a Github account
Go to github.com, click "Sign up", and follow the prompts to enter your email address, create a password and username, and solve a verification puzzle.  You will then need to verify your email address by entering a launch code sent to your inbox to complete the account creation.

- [ ] Navigate to https://github.com/.
- [ ] Click Sign up.
- [ ] Alternatively, click on Continue with Google to sign up using social login
- [ ] Follow the prompts to create your personal account.

During sign up, you'll be asked to verify your email address. Without a verified email address, you won't be able to complete some basic GitHub tasks, such as creating a repository.

Some enterprises create managed user accounts for their users. You can't sign up for a personal account with an email address that's already verified for a managed user account.

If you're having problems verifying your email address, there are some troubleshooting steps you can take.
